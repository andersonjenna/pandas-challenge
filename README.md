Run the file "PyCitySchools_analysis" in Jupyter Notebook.

In this analysis, I reviewed 15 high schools with a mix of both District and Charter type schools.
The size, budgets, and grade years were analyzed in producing math and reading scores, as well as passing rates for math, reading, and overall.

Conclusions that can be drawn from this data are that Charter type schools have higher success rates than District type schools.
Surprisingly, the schools that had lower spending ranges per student had higher overall passing results than schools with higher spending ranges.
Small (<1000) and Medium (1000-2000) sized schools had significantly higher overall passing rates than Large (2000-5000) sized schools.
